# Observing GenAI apps with open-source Monocle

This repository contains source code for an [AI assistant](#about-this-ai-assistant) that answers questions about coffee to demo how you can use open-source [Monocle](#about-monocle) to make observing and improving GenAI apps easy.

[Ask a question](https://monocle2ai.okahu.io) about coffee and this AI assistant will answer based on a Wikipedia page about coffee using an LLM. You can then explore telemetry to view the traces captured by Monocle resulting from this interaction. 

### About Monocle 

<img src="assets/img/monocle-chat-aws.png" width="320">

[Monocle](http://monocle2ai.org/) is a GenAI-native community driven open source project created to simplify instrumentation of AI apps so app developers can built high impact, safe and reliable AI apps. 

Monocle is currently a [Sandbox](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/monocle/) project in Linux Foundation AI & Data. In it's first iteration, Monocle helps app developers make GenAI apps observable without having to write last-mile monitoring code. 

### About this AI assistant

This AI assistant is a simple chatbot with the front-end built with Next.js and the GenAI code built with Langchain framework that relies on an OpenAI GPT model. The app is hosted in AWS with the GenAI code served as Lambda function that calls OpenAI for model inference. 

The GenAI app code is instrumented with Monocle using one line of code to trace the entire conversation including inferences to OpenAI and vector searchs. Monocle is configured to send traces to S3 so you can explore the raw trace data, which is in an OpenTelemetry compatible format with a GenAI-native metamodel abstraction added to it to simplify analysis. 

## Play with this AI assistant

- Open a chat window and ask this AI assistant a question about coffee
-- [Ask a question](https://monocle2ai.okahu.io) 

- Check out the traces generated by Monocle 
-- Click on the [View Telemetry](https://monocle2ai.okahu.io/s3) button to see a list of trace files on S3. 
-- Click on a specific trace file to see the content in a modal view. 

## Deploy this app in your cloud

This repository includes two versions of the app where the GenAI code is built in TypeScript or Python. We also have versions of this code built with other frameworks like LlamaIndex and hosted on other clouds like Microsoft Azure. Monocle works identically irrespective of how your GenAI app is coded or where it's hosted.
